# This folder is used to store datasets for CNN training
## The steps are as follows:
* (1)Create a new folder "EIC_data" under this folder
* (2)Copy the manually sorted EIC images (1. noise, 2.peak) to the noise and peak folders under data_set/EIC_data/EIC_photo, respectively.
* (3)Run split_data.py under the data_set file to automatically divide the above binary classified EIC images into a training set and a validation set.
